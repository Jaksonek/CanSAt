About us
At Nebula, we are a group of passionate and driven high school students united by our interest for space. Established in the middle of 2023, our team has been dedicated to the exciting world of CanSat development and competition.

But what’s actually CanSat?
A CanSat is a European Space Agency’s competition. Participants build a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drinks can. The challenge for the students is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors, and a communication system, into this minimal volume. The CanSat is then launched by a rocket up to an altitude of approximately one kilometre, or dropped from a platform, drone, or captive balloon. Then its mission begins. This involves carrying out a scientific experiment and/or a technology demonstration, achieving a safe landing, and analysing the data collected. 

Who we are?
Nebula is composed of a group of five students of Fifth High School in Bielsko-Biała. They are specialists in various disciplines, including aerospace engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, and microbiology. This diversity enables to solve problems, no one has ever done before.


Mikołaj Kurowski

Team leader and originator of the project. He’s responsible for the biological part of the probe.


Hania Jenczelewska

Marketing specialist. She coordinates Nebula’s budget and manages its social media.


Mateusz Śliwa

Mechanical and electrical engineer. He design our probe in 3D, its circuits and make sure the whole can will work.


Kuba Zipser

Programmer. He codes all of our systems and helps Mateusz with electronics.


Sonia Pawińska

Physicist. She watches over the correctness of our calculations, designs the recovery system and makes our graphics.

Our mission
Every CanSat has its primary and secondary mission. The basic requirement of every probe is measurement of temperature and pressure. For the rest of their mission, all teams remain free. As for us one of the most fascinating field of space exploration is astrobiology, we chose to study, what microogranisms do live in lower troposphere. For now, the exact way how we want to do it remains unknown, but you can already find some clues in the Technology page.
