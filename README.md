# Our mission
Every CanSat has its primary and secondary mission. The basic requirement of every probe is measurement of temperature and pressure. For the rest of their mission, all teams remain free. As for us one of the most fascinating field of space exploration is astrobiology, we chose to study, what microogranisms do live in lower troposphere. For now, the exact way how we want to do it remains unknown, but you can already find some clues in the Technology page.
